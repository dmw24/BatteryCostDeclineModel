# Battery Cost Decline Explorer

An interactive single-page model for exploring how different battery chemistries decline in cost under Wright's law as market uptake accelerates.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to launch the experience. You can tweak:

- **Market uptake assumptions** – baseline year, forecast horizon, total doublings of cumulative production, and the cadence of adoption (steady, front-loaded, back-loaded, or S-curve).
- **Chemistry parameters** – baseline cell price, materials floor, and learning rate for LFP, NMC-811, and Sodium-ion chemistries.

The chart, summary tiles, and forecast table update instantly to reflect the inputs, making it easy to reason about how learning rates and materials floors shape future battery costs.
